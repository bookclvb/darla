Wow! I've been slow to start this project, but I'm excited to be applying Git more practically WHILE learning 
how to use a static site generator. I can see a lot of potential uses for the format and love to see how many 
documentation hubs are built with Hugo. This also feels like a great way to **dabble** with my existing HTML 
and CSS skills via theme modification, and I'm finally getting the hang of Markdown and loving it (especially for `code snippets` and tables). 
I love that working with static sites forces you to see at a website as a framework for 
content/information that renders a front-end as a finishing touch. As a visually oriented person, separating how a site
feels/looks from its content and information architecture has always been tough.  

Git-wise, this is a real test of my learning. Thank goodness for tons of readily available documentation - thank you open source community!
Many of the basic concepts have settled into my brain, but I often second-guess myself on the particulars: e.g. does it matter which directory I'm in
when I commit changes? (YES.) Should I be forking or branching? Am I supposed to be using a specific grammatical tense in my commit messages? (LOL). 

I have a mess of new cheatsheets for command line, git and markdown taped over my desk. I know I need to play around a lot more before I'm really comfortable (merging and forking especially),
but now I'm excited to do that. Thank you [@chrisdaaz](https://github.com/chrisdaaz)!
