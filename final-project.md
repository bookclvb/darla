# Final Project Completion requirements

This assignment is about taking your project proposal and turning it into (at least) the shell of a workable example of using Git and GitHub in a library context. I hope that you will use this opportunity to dig into the kind of work that motivated you to enroll in this course, but I will be happy examining demonstrations of Git version control and GitHub project management in action. 

At a minimum, you will need to turn in the following a git repository hosted on GitHub with your project files, as well as:

- Five GitHub Issues (open or closed) describing tasks that need to be completed on the project
- A GitHub Project Board that displays the priority of the Issues that need to be addressed
- One of the following: a GitHub Action that is triggered automatically or a website hosted on GitHub Pages (note that some of the examples in the Project Proposal assignment already include GitHub Actions and GitHub Pages features)
- A brief reflection (one or more paragraphs) explaining how git and github support the project. This can be included in the README file of the final project repository, or submitted to me here in Moodle. 

Share the link to the repository (if it's public) or add @chrisdaaz as a contributor to send an invite to the repository (public or private) [instructions on inviting collaborators on GitHub].
